![Me](/static/selfie.png) Hi there, my name is Aris Dimopoulos, I'm a physicist working in the 
Renewable Energy sector as a Performance Analyst, developing tools and 
analytical pipelines to assure optimal performance of Solar and Wind assets.

This is my personal web space where I would like to explore around the concept of **digital garden** .
The idea is borrowed from [from Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) 
I really like the idea of a *space* where things grow exactly as in a physical garden but in the digital world. 

fist attempt to start working on a personal "digital garden". Have been thinking about this for some time (years?) but finally was inspired by the work of the [Hundred Rabbits](http://100r.co/site/home.html). They don't know me but this is the beauty of a culture that is open and free. Will inspire and motivate through the work and ideas of others. I'm not trying to seal ideas or create copies I would like to use ideas from other to allow me to express myself and reflect.
